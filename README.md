# 🚀 Jetfyx — React + Vite Landing Page

Jetfyx is a personal project built to explore modern frontend tools and deployment workflows. It’s a responsive, animated landing page powered by:

- ⚛️ **React + Vite** — Fast dev server, HMR, and optimized builds
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- 🌀 **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations and transitions
- 🗺️ **Leaflet** — Interactive maps with custom markers and tiles
- 🔀 **React Router** — Client-side routing for multi-section navigation

## 🗺️ Map Integration
Jetfyx uses Leaflet for rendering maps. You can customize the map view, markers, and tile layers in the ```Map.jsx```component.
